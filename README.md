This file contains the Racket written during my time in CSCI301
It includes:

-Evaluator of listed methods and testing file

-Parser for that evaluator

Basically it takes a method that uses any environment of references and 
a list of values to evaluate and evaluates it as if it was ran on it's own

You can also use the parse method if you don't wanna make a list, as it allows
for parsing capabilities for the evaluated function

The testing file should have no output if ran successfully.
