This file contains the Racket written during my time in CSCI301
It includes:
-Evaluator of listed methods and testing file

Basically it takes a method that uses any environment of references and 
a list of values to evaluate and evaluates it as if it was ran on it's own

The testing file should have no output if ran successfully.
